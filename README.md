# CodeBunny 🐰

A GitHub Action for AI-powered code reviews using Continue Agent.

## Overview

CodeBunny is a GitHub Action that provides intelligent, context-aware code reviews on your pull requests using [Continue's AI capabilities](https://continue.dev). It analyzes your codebase patterns, applies custom rules, and provides actionable feedback.

### Why CodeBunny?

**Own Your Review Data** - Unlike SaaS code review services, CodeBunny runs entirely in your GitHub Actions environment. Your code never leaves your repository, and all review data stays under your control.

**Powered by Continue** - Built on [Continue](https://www.continue.dev/), the leading open-source AI code assistant. Use Continue's hosted service or [bring your own key (BYOK)](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/understanding-configs) for complete control.

**Battle-Tested** - Inspired by existing code review tools and refined in the [contributor.info](https://github.com/bdougie/contributor.info) repository. Now generalized for any JavaScript/TypeScript project.

## Features

✅ **Automated AI Reviews** - Reviews are triggered automatically on PR creation and updates  
✅ **Codebase Pattern Analysis** - Understands your project's conventions and architecture  
✅ **Custom Rules** - Define project-specific review guidelines  
✅ **Interactive Commands** - Trigger focused reviews with `@codebunny` mentions  
✅ **Sticky Progress Comments** - Single updating comment instead of spam  
✅ **Privacy-First** - Runs in your GitHub Actions, your code never leaves your repo  
✅ **Bring Your Own Key** - Use Continue's Hub or [BYOK](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/understanding-configs) for full control  

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository with pull requests
- Node.js 20+ (automatically available in GitHub Actions)
- A [Continue account](https://hub.continue.dev) (or [BYOK setup](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/understanding-configs))
- A Continue Assistant configured for code reviews

### Step 1: Create a GitHub App

Create a GitHub App with these permissions:
- **Contents**: Read
- **Issues**: Write  
- **Pull Requests**: Write

**Need help?** See the [Detailed GitHub App Setup Guide](actions/codebunny/README.md#prerequisites)

### Step 2: Configure Repository Secrets

Add these to your repository settings (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

#### Variables (Required)
- `CONTINUE_ORG` - Your Continue Hub organization name
- `CONTINUE_CONFIG` - Your Continue assistant path (format: `username/assistant-name`)

#### Secrets (Required)
- `CONTINUE_API_KEY` - Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev](https://hub.continue.dev) (or your BYOK provider)

#### Optional: GitHub App (Recommended for enhanced permissions)

For better API rate limits and permissions, you can optionally set up a GitHub App:

**Variables:**
- `APP_ID` - Your GitHub App ID (found in app settings)

**Secrets:**
- `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` - The private key file content

**Without GitHub App:** The action will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with standard permissions.

### Step 3: Add Workflow to Your Repository

Create `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` in your repository:

#### Option A: Simple Setup (No GitHub App)

```yaml
name: Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@codebunny'))
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: CodeBunny Review
        uses: bdougie/codebunny/actions/codebunny@main
        with:
          continue-api-key: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}
          continue-org: ${{ vars.CONTINUE_ORG }}
          continue-config: ${{ vars.CONTINUE_CONFIG }}
```

#### Option B: With GitHub App (Enhanced Permissions)

```yaml
name: Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@codebunny'))
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Optional: Generate GitHub App token
      - name: Generate App Token
        id: app-token
        if: vars.APP_ID != ''
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - name: CodeBunny Review
        uses: bdougie/codebunny/actions/codebunny@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token || github.token }}
          continue-api-key: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}
          continue-org: ${{ vars.CONTINUE_ORG }}
          continue-config: ${{ vars.CONTINUE_CONFIG }}
```

### Step 4: Test It Out

1. **Create a test PR** or push changes to an existing one
2. **Watch for the CodeBunny comment** - It will appear automatically
3. **Try interactive commands** - Comment `@codebunny review this` on any PR

## Alternative: Self-Hosted Installation

If you prefer to host the action in your own repository:

1. Copy the `actions/codebunny` folder to your repository
2. Update the workflow to use the local path:
   ```yaml
   - name: CodeBunny Review
     uses: ./actions/codebunny
   ```

## Custom Rules

Create review rules in `.continue/rules/` to enforce project-specific standards:

```markdown
---
globs: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
description: "TypeScript Standards"
---

# TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Avoid 'any' types
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- Use proper error handling
```

### Example Rules

**Security Rule** (`.continue/rules/security.md`):
```markdown
---
globs: "**/*.{ts,js,tsx,jsx}"
description: "Security Review"
alwaysApply: true
---

# Security Checklist

- No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- Verify authentication/authorization
```

**Testing Rule** (`.continue/rules/testing.md`):
```markdown
---
globs: "**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
description: "Testing Standards"
---

# Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests focused and isolated
```

## Interactive Commands

Comment on any PR to trigger focused reviews:

```
@codebunny check for security issues
@codebunny review the TypeScript types
@codebunny explain the architecture changes
@codebunny suggest performance improvements
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DEBUG_MODE=true` - Enable verbose logging
- `CONTINUE_API_KEY` - Your Continue API key
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub App installation token

### Metrics Tracking

The action tracks review metrics in `.continue/review-metrics.json`:
- Processing time
- Issues found by priority
- Rules applied
- Patterns detected

View metrics in your review comments.

## Troubleshooting

### "Continue CLI not found"
- The action installs the CLI automatically
- Check if `@continuedev/cli` is accessible
- Verify Node.js 20+ is available

### "Authentication failed"
- Verify your GitHub App ID and private key
- Ensure the App is installed on the repository
- Check App permissions match requirements

### "No review generated"
- Check Continue API key is valid
- Verify assistant configuration
- Look for errors in action logs
